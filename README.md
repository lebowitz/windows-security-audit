# Windows Security Audit Tools

A collection of PowerShell scripts for detecting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) on Windows systems. These tools help security professionals and system administrators quickly assess potential security threats.

## üîç Overview

This repository contains PowerShell scripts that check for common signs of compromise including:
- Failed login attempts
- Suspicious PowerShell activity
- Unusual service installations
- Active network connections
- Recently created scheduled tasks
- Suspicious startup items

## üöÄ Quick Start

```powershell
# Run the quick security check
.\quick_security_check.ps1

# Run comprehensive audit (requires admin privileges)
.\comprehensive_audit.ps1

# View help and available parameters
.\quick_security_check.ps1 -Help
.\comprehensive_audit.ps1 -Help
```

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis with Claude Code

Both scripts now feature automatic AI analysis when [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) is installed on your system (either in Windows or WSL). After completing the security scan, Claude analyzes the results and provides:

- **Risk Assessment**: Critical/High/Medium/Low rating
- **Security Summary**: Concise overview of findings
- **Top Concerns**: Prioritized list of security issues
- **Recommended Actions**: Immediate steps to take
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies trends and anomalies

### Example Claude Analysis Output

```
[2025-07-19 10:46:38] [Warning] === CLAUDE SECURITY ANALYSIS ===
## Security Analysis Summary
**Brief Summary:** The audit detected 3 failed login attempts, extensive PowerShell 
scriptblock logging activity (false positive), and multiple kernel driver installations 
from MSI Center and AMD software. No RDP connections or suspicious process creation 
were found.
**Risk Assessment:** **LOW-MEDIUM**

## Top Security Concerns
1. **Failed Login Attempts** - 3 failed login attempts detected with failure reason 
   %%2313 (unknown username or bad password)
2. **Kernel Driver Installations** - Multiple kernel-mode drivers installed by MSI 
   Center and AMD Tools, which have low-level system access
3. **Repetitive Service Installations** - Same drivers being installed multiple times 
   on different dates (July 12, 14, 18)

## Recommended Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate Failed Logins:** Check if these were legitimate login attempts or 
   potential unauthorized access attempts
2. **Verify MSI Center/AMD Drivers:** Confirm these are legitimate installations 
   from your hardware management software
3. **PowerShell Logging:** The extensive PowerShell alerts appear to be false 
   positives from legitimate NetAdapter module loading - consider tuning detection rules

## Patterns Detected
- **False Positive Pattern:** All PowerShell alerts are from legitimate Windows 
  NetAdapter module scriptblock creation
- **Service Pattern:** MSI Center appears to be reinstalling the same drivers 
  repeatedly, suggesting possible software issues or updates
- No actual malicious activity detected - all findings appear to be legitimate 
  system activity

## üìÅ Logging and Output

All scripts create daily rolling logs in the `logs/` subdirectory:
- `quick_security_check_YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- `comprehensive_audit_YYYY-MM-DD.log`

Key features:
- **Daily rotation**: New log file each day
- **Timestamped entries**: All events logged with precise timestamps
- **Severity levels**: Info, Warning, Error, Success, Alert
- **Console + File output**: See results in real-time and review later
- **Custom log directory**: Use `-LogDirectory` parameter

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checks Performed

### 1. **Login Monitoring**
- Checks Event ID 4625 (Failed logins)
- Checks Event ID 4624 (Successful logins, especially Type 10 for RDP)
- Monitors for brute force attempts

### 2. **PowerShell Activity**
- Scans Event ID 4104 (PowerShell script block logging)
- Looks for keywords: `download`, `invoke-expression`, `encodedcommand`, `hidden`, `bypass`
- Helps detect fileless malware and living-off-the-land techniques

### 3. **Service Monitoring**
- Checks Event ID 7045 (New service installations)
- Critical for detecting persistence mechanisms

### 4. **Network Connections**
- Lists all established connections to external IPs
- Filters out local/private IP ranges
- Shows process names for each connection

### 5. **Scheduled Tasks**
- Reviews recently created scheduled tasks
- Common persistence method for malware

### 6. **Process Creation**
- Monitors Event ID 4688 (Process creation)
- Focuses on commonly abused executables

## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- Administrator privileges (for full audit capabilities)
- Audit policies enabled for comprehensive logging
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (optional, for AI analysis)

## üîß Configuration

### Enable PowerShell Script Block Logging
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging" -Name "EnableScriptBlockLogging" -Value 1

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **False Positives**: PowerShell logging often captures legitimate system scripts
2. **Performance**: These scripts may take time on systems with large event logs
3. **Privileges**: Some checks require administrative rights
4. **Privacy**: Always redact sensitive information when sharing output
